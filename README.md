# Effects of Initial Pressure and Temperature on Maximum Explosion Pressure of LPG Mixture
This project contains C++ codes that predict the maximum explosion pressure of LPG mixture based on the given data of initial pressure and temperature. I have used polynomial regression to develop this code. The code generates results with an accuracy of 98.8%.
